    Scouting has shaped who I am for as long as I can remember. I grew up in Troop 222 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I earned my Eagle Scout rank, fueled by a love of adventure, challenge, and friendship.

  <p>
    Today, I’m proud to serve as Scoutmaster of Troop 10 in Johns Creek, Georgia — helping guide the next generation of Scouts through camping trips, backpacking adventures, and leadership challenges. But truthfully, being a Scout leader has been even more rewarding than being a Scout ever was. Watching young people grow in confidence, character, and teamwork is what keeps me coming back.
